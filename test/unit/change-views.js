// invoking next() and prev() effectively changes the selected view

// wrap around if loop is true, don't wrap around if loop is false

// check if navigation buttons are disabled when loop is false, and always on when loop is true (try changing the loop attribute and navigatin with prev/next/selected during tests)

// check that views always have the correct translation value (w/ loop, w/o loop)
// (try changing the loop attribute and navigatin with prev/next/selected during tests)

// check that loop can be set only if there are at least 2 views

// make sure that changes in the dom are triggering updates in the pagination

// try setting random values for selected

// try setting random values for loop

// clicking a navigation button goes to prev/next (is it e2e?)
