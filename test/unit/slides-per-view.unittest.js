// Make sure that given the number of slides and the slides-per-view, the right number of views is computed

// Try setting random values for slides-per-view

// Make sure that each slide belongs to the right view

// Make sure that the last view leave empty spaces if the number of slides is not exact

// Make sure that changing the number of slides-per-view correctly resets the slider styles. The selected attribute should be applied to the new configuration (if still in range) otherwise it should be set to the closest value possible.

// Make sure that after changing the number of slides (light DOM) the selected attribute is updated correctly, together with the 'slides-per-view'
